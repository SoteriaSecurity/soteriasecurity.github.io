        <p id="team_subtitle">Our team was formed by one question: How do we save people? Named after the Greek goddess for security, Soteria came to life from a group of students who wanted to address pressing issues, and after hearing about historical incidents like Uvalde, Sandy Hook, and Columbine, they decided to act. The team came together, ready to work towards making a difference and saving the lives of their fellow students.</p>
